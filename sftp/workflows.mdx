# SFTP Workflows

This page covers the most common day-to-day SFTP usage patterns.

## Upload Local to Remote

1. Connect to a host.
2. Open SFTP for the session.
3. Navigate to local source path in left pane.
4. Navigate to remote target path in right pane.
5. Drag files/folders from local to remote.

## Download Remote to Local

1. Open remote path in right pane.
2. Open local destination in left pane.
3. Drag from remote to local.

## Remote to Remote Transfer

1. Ensure both remote sessions are active.
2. Start transfer from source remote path.
3. Select destination host/path.
4. Monitor progress and failures.

## Bulk Operations

- Multi-select files/folders
- Run delete/download/upload in bulk
- Track operation progress and cancel when needed

## Path Navigation and Autocomplete

- Double-click folders to enter
- Use path input for direct navigation
- Remote path autocomplete applies to connected remote sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Folder Double-Click Does Not Open

- Verify current session is active.
- Verify SFTP list listener is not stale/colliding.

### Remote Path Autocomplete Not Working

- Confirm session is remote (not local-only context).
- Confirm current connection is alive and SFTP client is available.
