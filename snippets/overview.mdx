Snippets help you reuse common commands without retyping.

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete snippets
- Organize snippet content for repeated tasks
- Run snippets in active terminal sessions

## Suggested Snippet Types

- Deployment commands
- Service restart/check commands
- Log inspection commands
- Environment bootstrap commands

## Best Practices

- Keep snippet names action-oriented (`Restart Nginx`, `Check Disk Usage`).
- Prefer safe defaults and explicit flags.
- Review commands before running in production.

## Troubleshooting

### Snippet Does Not Run as Expected

- Confirm an active terminal session exists.
- Verify shell compatibility of command syntax.
- Confirm required environment variables are set.
