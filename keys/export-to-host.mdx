# Export Public Key to Host

Use key export to append a public key to a remote host so that key-based login works.

## Steps

1. Open **Keys**.
2. Select the key to export.
3. Click export action.
4. Choose target connection.
5. Confirm export.

## Expected Result

- Success toast: key exported to host.
- On failure: UI should show detailed backend error message.

## Common Errors

### `no valid authentication method configured for this connection`

The target connection does not have usable authentication settings for export.

Check:

- Username/host/port are valid
- Auth method is configured correctly
- Required credentials or key references exist

### Permission Denied Writing `authorized_keys`

- Remote user may not have write permissions to `~/.ssh`
- Remote home directory may be restricted

## Validation

After export, test SSH login with the matching private key.
