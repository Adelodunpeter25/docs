Manage SSH keys used by your saved connections.

## What You Can Do

- Generate new SSH keys
- Import existing private keys
- Rename and delete saved keys
- Export public keys to remote hosts

## Generating Keys

Create keys from the Keys section and save them for reuse in connection profiles.

## Importing Keys

You can import private keys by pasting key content or selecting a key file.

If the key is encrypted, provide its passphrase.

## Using Keys in Connections

In a connection profile:

1. Set auth method to **Public Key**
2. Select a saved key
3. Save and connect

## Exporting Public Key to Host

FreeSH can append your public key to the remote host `authorized_keys`.

If export fails, the error shown in UI should include backend detail (for example auth method/config issues).

## Troubleshooting

### Key Export Failed

- Ensure target connection is valid and reachable.
- Ensure authentication method for the connection is correctly configured.
- Ensure remote user has write access to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
