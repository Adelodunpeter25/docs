# Disconnect and Reconnect

When a remote session drops unexpectedly, FreeSH keeps the tab and shows a disconnect notification in the bottom-left.

## What You See

For unexpected disconnects:

- Session status becomes disconnected
- Notification shows the tab title
- Available actions:
- `Reconnect`
- `Close Tab`

For user-initiated disconnects:

- No reconnect notification is shown

## Reconnect Flow

1. Click `Reconnect` on the disconnect notification.
2. FreeSH reuses the saved connection configuration.
3. A new session is created and the existing tab is rebound to the new session.

If reconnect succeeds:

- Notification is removed
- Tab remains open with the reconnected terminal

If reconnect fails:

- Error toast is shown
- Notification remains, so you can retry or close tab

## Notes

- Workspace-contained sessions should also surface disconnect notifications.
- Tabs are not auto-closed on unexpected disconnect.

## Troubleshooting

### No Disconnect Notification Appears

- Confirm the disconnect was not user-initiated.
- Confirm session lifecycle listener is active (not removed by another service handler).
- Confirm tab/session mapping exists (including workspace session ids).

### Reconnect Button Does Nothing

- Verify connection details still exist in local storage.
- Check authentication method is still valid for the host.
