# Terminal Features

FreeSH uses tabbed terminal sessions for both remote SSH and local shell access.

## Sessions and Tabs

- Open multiple terminal tabs
- Rename and pin tabs
- Duplicate local or remote terminal tabs
- Switch tabs with keyboard shortcuts

## Local Terminal

FreeSH can open a local shell session in a terminal tab.

History hook coverage currently includes:

- `bash`
- `zsh`
- `fish`
- `powershell` / `pwsh`

`sh` is intentionally excluded.

## Disconnect and Reconnect UX

When a remote session disconnects unexpectedly:

- A disconnect notification appears in the bottom-left
- You can choose **Reconnect** or **Close Tab**

User-initiated disconnects do not trigger the reconnect notification.

## Terminal Sidebar Features

- Command history list
- Saved snippets
- Search/filter support for history

## Logging

Terminal sessions can be logged and reviewed later from Session Logs.

## Troubleshooting

### Session Closed Unexpectedly

- Check remote host availability and network stability.
- Use reconnect action from disconnect notification.
- If reconnect fails repeatedly, verify credentials and server auth settings.

### Backspace or Terminal Input Behaves Wrong

- Ensure your shell and terminal environment are correctly initialized.
- Confirm `TERM` is set (for local shells this is auto-set by FreeSH when missing).
