title: Port Forwarding
description: Create and manage SSH tunnels
---

FreeSH supports standard SSH tunneling modes for secure network access.

## Supported Modes

- Local forwarding
- Remote forwarding
- Dynamic forwarding (SOCKS)

## Typical Use Cases

- Access internal services through SSH
- Expose local services to a remote network
- Route browser/tools traffic through SOCKS proxy

## Managing Tunnels

You can create tunnel configs, start/stop them, and monitor active status.

If configured, some tunnels can auto-start after session connection.

## Troubleshooting

### Tunnel Fails to Start

- Check local/remote bind ports are free.
- Verify remote SSH account allows forwarding.
- Confirm destination host/port is reachable from the SSH server.
