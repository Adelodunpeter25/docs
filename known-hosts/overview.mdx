# Known Hosts Management

Known hosts protect you against man-in-the-middle attacks by validating server identity.

## How It Works

- First connection prompts for host key trust
- Accepted fingerprints are stored locally
- Future mismatches are flagged for security review

## Managing Known Hosts

From the Known Hosts section, you can:

- Review stored host fingerprints
- Remove outdated or invalid host entries
- Import hosts from your SSH environment

## When to Remove an Entry

Remove a host key only when:

- Server was rebuilt/reprovisioned
- Host key rotation was expected
- You confirmed infrastructure change is legitimate

## Security Note

Do not blindly trust changed host keys. Validate fingerprints through a trusted channel.
