Use the Connections view to manage saved SSH hosts and open sessions quickly.

## What You Can Do

- Create saved SSH connections
- Edit host, port, username, auth method, and grouping
- Organize connections into groups
- Connect directly from the list
- Delete stale connections

## Creating a Connection

1. Open **Home** and go to **Connections**.
2. Click **New Connection**.
3. Fill in:
- Name
- Host
- Port (default `22`)
- Username
- Authentication method
4. Save and connect.

## Authentication Options

- **Password**: Password is stored securely in your system keychain.
- **Public Key**: Use an existing key or paste/import a private key; passphrase is supported.

## Organizing Connections

Use groups to keep environments separated, for example:

- Production
- Staging
- Personal

This makes quick filtering and navigation easier as your host list grows.

## Updating and Deleting

- Edit connection details from the connection form.
- Delete connections you no longer use.
- Deleting a saved connection does not delete remote data on the server.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Fails

- Confirm host and port are reachable.
- Verify SSH service is running on the remote host.
- Check firewall/network rules.

### Authentication Errors

- Confirm username.
- Confirm selected auth method matches server config.
- If using a key, verify passphrase and key format.

### Host Verification Prompt

On first connect, verify and trust the host key only if the fingerprint is expected.
